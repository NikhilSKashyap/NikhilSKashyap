Hi! I'm Nikhil Kashyap, a Machine Learning Engineer with ~5 years of work experience. My interest is to understand how to design ML systems for specific business problems. In doing this, I've looked to understand the patterns of good ML design and the processes that support MLOps. I've become a big fan of agile approaches. I‚Äôm skilled in Machine Learning, Statistics, Problem Solving, and Programming.

Update: I will be flying to University of Washington, Seattle for Fall 2022 to pursue my Masters in Electrical Engineering.

Update: I started working as a fully funded RA at [unBIASED lab](https://www.unbiased.health/team). 

Update: I'm looking for summer 2023 internships in Data Science & Machine Learning. 

Update: I interned at Brainchip as a Solutions Architect over the summer 2023.

Update: My paper on leveraging LLMs for HAR was accepted at GenAI4PC symposium at UbicComp 2023. I presented my work to fellow researchers at Cancun, Mexico. 

Update: I'm looking for Full Time roles in MLE/DS, TPM for ML/DS teams.
